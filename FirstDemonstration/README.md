# First Demonstration

A very rough sketch of what tools can be used for the project and how we can move towards a prototype.

## Core libraries used are:
BASE: [p5js](https://p5js.org/)

BODY & HEAD TRACKING: [poseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)

FACE TRACKING: [clmtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackrp5js)


## How to use it:
Works best when you're about 4ft from the camera and your head, shoulders and arms are in the frame.

If you stand further away you can see how posenet draws a full body skeleton, but you will probably
lose the face-detection at this distance.
